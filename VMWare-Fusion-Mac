# Windows Virtualization Lab: VMware Fusion Configuration

This documentation details the deployment of a Windows Virtual Machine on a resource-constrained 2017 MacBook Air. The objective was to create a functional lab environment while balancing the 8GB physical RAM limitation of the host hardware.

## 🛠 Technical Environment
* **Host OS:** macOS (Clean Install)
* **Hypervisor:** VMware Fusion Player
* **Guest OS:** Windows 10
* **Host Hardware:** 1.8GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 / 8GB RAM

---

## ⚙️ Virtual Machine Configuration
To ensure system stability, a strict resource allocation strategy was implemented. Over-provisioning the VM would lead to disk swapping and host failure.

### Hardware Specifications
| Component | Setting | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Processor** | 2 Cores | Utilizes full physical core count for parallel processing. |
| **Memory** | 3072 MB (3GB) | Provides sufficient overhead for Windows while leaving 5GB for macOS. |
| **Disk Type** | NVMe / SATA | Thin-provisioned (not pre-allocated) to conserve physical SSD space. |
| **Graphics** | 1024 MB | Accelerated 3D graphics enabled for UI fluidity. |

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

### 1. Hypervisor Initialization
VMware Fusion Player was configured for personal use. A Windows ISO was mapped as a virtual optical drive to initiate the boot sequence.

### 2. Network Architecture
The network adapter was set to **Bridged Mode**. Unlike NAT (Network Address Translation), Bridged mode allows the VM to:
* Receive a unique IP address from the local DHCP server.
* Act as a transparent node on the home network.
* Support incoming connections for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

### 3. Guest Optimization (VMware Tools)
Post-installation, **VMware Tools** was injected into the guest OS. This suite of utilities provides:
* Optimized SVGA video drivers.
* Shared folders and clipboard integration.
* Improved mouse latency and memory ballooning drivers.

---

## 📈 Optimization Results
* **Footprint:** The VM maintains a lean disk footprint of ~20GB (fresh install).
* **Stability:** The host Mac remains responsive for documentation and browser tasks while the VM is active.
* **Connectivity:** Successfully verified network visibility across the local homelab subnet.
